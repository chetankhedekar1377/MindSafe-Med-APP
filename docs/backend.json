    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to ensure Authorization Independence, DBAC, and QAPs. User data and their related entities (SymptomLogs, Medications, MedicationReminders, Appointments, and HealthInsights) are stored under the `/users/{userId}` path, which grants clear path-based ownership, simplifying security rules. This structure facilitates atomic operations (transactions/batches) without needing to `get()` parent data, crucial for maintaining data integrity and consistency.\n\n*   **Authorization Independence**: Achieved through path-based ownership for private user data, eliminating the need for `get()` calls in security rules.\n*   **QAPs (Rules are not Filters)**: Supported by Structural Segregation, where each collection under `/users/{userId}` has a homogeneous security posture, enabling efficient and secure `list` operations. For example, listing all SymptomLogs for a specific user is easily secured via path-based rules without content-based filtering.\n\nThis design promotes clear authorization intent, straightforward security rules, and optimized query performance by avoiding complex rule logic and ensuring each collection serves a distinct security purpose."
